# Muggle Config

Configuration without the magic.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robations/muggle-config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robations/muggle-config)


## Why

Designed as a drop in replacement* for the doughty node-config module. Node-config fits lots of use cases, but I often
find it becomes hard to use when I have a more complex requirement, such as multiple config inheritance. In my opinion
it tries to do too much work automatically by taking instructions from the environment and by trying to be a singleton.
This project aims to be both simpler to understand and more configurable, which is handy for a module handling
configuration.

<small>\* This is a lie, it differs in many significant ways. However it has enough similarities to make replacing
existing usages within the bounds of feasibility.</small>


## How

```
$ npm i muggle-config
```

```typescript
import {load} from "muggle-config";

const myConfig = load("./config/wayne.yaml");
const someValue = myConfig.foo; // "bar"
```

```yaml
# ./config/wayne.yaml
foo: bar
```

The returned configuration object is an instance of [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) which provides
a flexible interface for querying objects and object paths.

You can explicitly create multiple configuration hierarchies:

```yaml
# ./config/harold.yaml
_imports:
    # resolved relative to current config file
    - wayne.yaml

# deep nested merging is the current behaviour
foo: buzz
```

Using the default configuration loader, the filetype will be detected from the file extension. The currently supported
filetypes are YAML (`.yaml`, `.yml`), CommonJS Javascript (`.js`) and JSON (`.json`).

You can also create your own configuration loader that must match the `Loader` interface. Hereâ€™s an example for loading
ini files:

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as ini from "ini";
import {resolve, dirname} from "path";
import {load} from "muggle-config";

function iniLoader(resource: string, context?: string) {
    // Resolve path relative to file.
    // You could also make your own rules here as long as your config files obey these rules.
    const resolved = context
        ? resolve(process.cwd(), dirname(context), resource)
        : resolve(resource)
    ;

    return {
        // The actual data as a JS object/array.
        data: ini.parse(fs.readFileSync(resolved, "utf-8")),

        // The resolved path (allows resolution of recursive configs).
        resolved: resolved
    };
}

const myConfig = load("graham.ini", iniLoader);
```

# Who

Contribute by trying out this module and reporting back any usability problems, questions or bugs on [the issue
tracker]([![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/robations/muggle-config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robations/muggle-config)).
Pull requests are welcome but please check before doing work to avoid disappointment.


# When

If you are interested to use the package but are put off by the *unstable* status, I aim to speed this module to a
stable v1 status over the next few months, preferably before Summer 2017. Any contributions, stress testing and
additional feedback will help.


## TODO

- [x] file extension loader (load files based on extension)
- [x] document basic usage
- [x] add some unit tests
- [x] ensure minimal npm publish (don't include bloat files)
- [x] set up continuous integration
- [ ] clearer documentation of common use cases
- [ ] add a changelog
- [ ] developer documentation
- [ ] blanket test coverage
- [ ] make sure all globals/environment is a parameter or optional parameter (such as `process.cwd()`)
- [ ] function that emulates node-config module more closely with `NODE_ENV` file loading
- [ ] allow to configure resolving imports
- [ ] mechanism to replace keys instead of merging?
- [ ] support synchronous and async loading?
