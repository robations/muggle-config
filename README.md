## Why

Originally designed as a replacement for
[config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config). The config module fits many use
cases, but lacks some flexibility in loading configuration. This project aims
to be simpler to understand and more configurable, which is handy for a module
handling configuration.


## How

```
$ npm i muggle-config
```

```typescript
import {load} from "muggle-config";

const myConfig = load("./config/wayne.yaml");
const someValue = myConfig.foo; // "bar"
```

```yaml
# ./config/wayne.yaml
foo: bar
```

You can explicitly create multiple configuration hierarchies:

```yaml
# ./config/harold.yaml
_imports:
    # resolved relative to current config file
    - wayne.yaml

# deep nested merging is the current behaviour
foo: buzz
```

Using the default configuration loader, the filetype will be detected from the
file extension. The currently supported filetypes are YAML (`.yaml`, `.yml`),
CommonJS Javascript (`.js`) and JSON (`.json`).

You can also create your own configuration loader that must match the `Loader`
interface. Here‚Äôs an example for loading ini files:

```typescript
import {readFileSync} from "fs";
import * as ini from "ini";
import {resolve, dirname} from "path";
import {load} from "muggle-config";

function iniLoader(resource: string, context?: string) {
    // Resolve path relative to file.
    // You could also make your own rules here as long as your config files obey these rules.
    const resolved = context
        ? resolve(process.cwd(), dirname(context), resource)
        : resolve(resource)
    ;

    return {
        // The actual data as a JS object/array.
        data: ini.parse(readFileSync(resolved, "utf-8")),

        // The resolved path (allows resolution of recursive configs).
        resolved: resolved
    };
}

const myConfig = load("graham.ini", iniLoader);
```

You can also merge in sensitive configuration parameters from another source
using the `loadWithParameters()` function. See the [getting
started](docs/getting-started.md) guide for this and more examples.

welcome but please check before doing work to avoid disappointment.


# Upgrading from v0.0.x to v1

1. Returned configuration no longer uses the ImmutableJS library and will be
Plain Old Javascript Objects.

2. Consider migrating away from using `loadEnv()` in preference to `load()` or
`loadWithParameters()`.

3. `muggle-config` now has a dependency on some `ramda` functions. Make sure
that tree-shaking is working if using in the browser.
